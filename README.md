# Convolution_Neural_Network
CNN on simple data:

          CNN has Convolution layer,maxpool layer,flatten layer and fully connected layer
(dense). The convolution layer takes input and finds appropriate filters(unique features
of the image), rectified linear unit activation function is added to remove linearity.
The maxpool layer helps to identify when filters are little away from the usual place
(in simple terms), and the flatten layer gives a 1D array, further layers are similar
to ANN where wights are updates after each batch.
